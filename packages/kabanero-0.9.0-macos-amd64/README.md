## kabanero login

Will authenticate you to a Kabanero instance

### Synopsis


	Logs in to a Kabanero instance using Github credentials, and stores a temporary access token for subsequent command line calls.
	The temporary authentication token will be stored in your-home-directory/.kabanero/config.yaml.
	Use your Github userid and either password or Personal Access Token (PAT).
	* If you use a GitHub Personal Access Token, make sure it has **read:org** scope. You can select this when creating your PAT in GitHub
	

```
kabanero login kabanero-cli-url -u Github userid 
  At the password prompt, enter your GitHub Password/PAT [flags]
```

### Examples

```

	# login with Github userid and password:
	kabanero login my.kabaneroInstance.io -u myGithubID 
	# login with previously used url Github userid and PAT:
	kabanero login -u myGithubID 
	
```

## kabanero deactivate

Remove the specified stack from the list of available application types, without deleting it from the Kabanero instance.

### Synopsis


Run the deactivate command to remove the specified stack from the list of available application types, without deleting it from the Kabanero instance.

This command is useful in a case where you have cloned a stack and customized it for your business needs. Deactivation keeps the base stack in the app hub. The base stack continues to be updated and the updates percolate up to your cloned stack. To restore a deactivated stack, run the kabanero refresh command.

```
kabanero deactivate stack-name version [flags]
```

  -h, --help   help for deactivate
