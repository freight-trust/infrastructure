      This policy connects authn identities to an application identity.
      It defines a layer named for an application that contains the
      whitelisted identities that can authenticate to the authn-k8s
      endpoint. Any permissions granted to the application layer will
      be inherited by the whitelisted authn identities, thereby
      granting access to the authenticated identity.)
